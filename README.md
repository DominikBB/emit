> ⚠️ There is no running build of this yet, very early dev!

### Goals

Create an event sourcing library which should have the simplest interface possible, be easy to set up, require minimal boilerplate, and utilize the OTP abilities for performance, consistency and parallelism.

I plan to implement the following features:

-   [ ] An aggregate actor
-   [ ] Support for defining commands and events
-   [ ] Support for defining projections

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
gleam shell # Run an Erlang shell
```
